Windows Text Editor Annotation Manager (OneNote similar - but much more simpler!)

This project is developed with SharpDevelop (yes, you have read right, [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/Default.aspx)!)

Feel free to contribute or anything else!

It is still in development, but it is already a little bit useful...

:)
